#Overview
RealTime Road Sense is a deep learning project that performs real-time object detection on car camera footage. The system is designed to detect and classify objects such as cars, pedestrians, and traffic lights using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. This project aims to enhance road safety and enable autonomous driving applications by providing accurate and efficient object detection in dynamic traffic scenarios
#Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset consisting of car camera footage capturing various traffic situations, including moving vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic lights.
